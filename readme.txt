== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the site connection secure? =

Yes. We use a secure authorization protocol (OAuth1.0a) for setting up the connection.

= If I connect my site, do you gain access to my site? =

No. Connecting your site is just a small exchange of keys meant to establish a way to securely send information, when needed. We don't have your passwords or other methods to gain access to your site.

If you have a support question that requires us to take a look in your WordPress dashboard, we will ask you for a *temporary username and password* with admin permissions. But **that is up to you to provide.**

= Is this plugin tracking me? =

No. We are not tracking you or your site. We ask your permission to share with us non-specific theme usage data and information about your WordPress install so we can resolve support questions faster - we are a small team and need to be as efficient as possible.

*It is up to you if you are willing to share this data with us.* We respect your decision. We truly appreciate it if you do, but we will do our best to serve you regardless.
